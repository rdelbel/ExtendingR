Extending R
=

This the the page for the talk I gave at the University of Toronto on November 26 2013. If you know how to use git(hub) you can clone this repository via
```github
git clone https://github.com/rdelbel/ExtendingR.git
```
in the command line. Otherwise you can download the files as a zip by pressing the download zip button on the right of the page. The sideshow plus all fo the R code from the talk will be in the zip. 

The exteneral references from the talk will be in the slideshow and may eventually be listed on this webpage. [(If you want to list them all here for me you can edit this page here)](https://github.com/rdelbel/ExtendingR/edit/master/README.md) [The most important reference is the website for my reportRx package which can be found here](https://www.github.com/rdelbel/reportRx/). It will provide high level documentation on how to set up and use knitr and reportRx. It will also link to the tutorials I went over during the talk (which are also found in the .zip file)
